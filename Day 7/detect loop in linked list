In this question we just had to return true if cycle exists and false it cycle doesn't exist. There is an advanced version of this question which is
FLOYD CYCLE -> in this we also need to return the connecting node.


class Solution {
    //Function to check if the linked list has a loop.
    public static boolean detectLoop(Node head)
    {
        // Add code here
        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head;
        
        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null)
        {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            
            if(slow==fast)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
